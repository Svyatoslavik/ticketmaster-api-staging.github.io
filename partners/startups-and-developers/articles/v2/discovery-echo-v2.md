## Ticketmaster for Amazon Echo

This is a voice-based application written for Amazon Echo devices. It allows you to search for events that are taking place around you, or for other events by using keywords. It features convenient navigation. It also provides details of events: place, time, event description. Additionally, it can show you ticket information on a paired mobile device, and let you use Gmail. It supports the RSS newsfeed, which is used for Gossips navigation.

It is written in Java and uses Maven for the build process.

All credential information has been removed from Ticketmaster, so you will need to add your own information before building the application.
