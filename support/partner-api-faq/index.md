## Partner Api General

{: #oauth-a .double-margin}
## Oauth

{: #qo-1}
#### Why do I receive "No valid access token found" when calling /oauth/info?
If it appears that from time to time the new /OAuth/info endpoint is giving an error "No valid access token found‚Äù check if token being used was expired. Once you have obtained an Access Token, you can use it until the time specified by the expires_in key in the response which is 3600 seconds (1 hour) . After that time, you need to get a new Access Token using the Refresh Token .

#### Why are users not redirected to my specified redirect_uri??
Verify your redirect_uri is specified for your developer-app in your Developer Account settings

{: #qo-3}
#### Why is my custom logo not displaying on any OAuth sign-in pages?
Check with the Partner api support if the logo url you are using is whitelisted.
